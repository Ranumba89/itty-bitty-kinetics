      At Itty Bitty Kinetics Therapy Group Inc., we know how overwhelming it can
      be to watch your child struggle with everyday activities like getting
      dressed, mealtimes, or joining in play with peers. If your little one
      faces developmental delays, sensory processing differences, or motor
      coordination challenges, you‚Äôre not alone ‚Äî and we‚Äôre here to help. Our
      therapy services are thoughtfully designed to meet your child where they
      are, reduce family stress, and build the skills that lead to confidence,
      independence, and joyful connection. Because your child deserves support
      that‚Äôs as unique as they are ‚Äî and so do you.
    </p>,
    <p>
      At Itty Bitty Kinetics Therapy Group Inc., our pediatric occupational
      therapy services are rooted in one simple belief: every child deserves the
      opportunity to thrive in their daily life ‚Äî at home, in the clinic, and
      out in the world. Whether your child is navigating developmental delays,
      sensory processing differences, motor coordination challenges, or
      diagnoses such as Autism Spectrum Disorder or Down Syndrome, our job is to
      meet your family with support that makes sense for your everyday reality.
    </p>,
    <p>
      Occupational therapy helps children build the foundational skills they
      need to participate in meaningful daily activities ‚Äî from getting dressed
      and feeding themselves to playing confidently with peers and managing big
      emotions. Our therapists work across all environments ‚Äî in-home, in our
      Encino clinic, or out in the community ‚Äî to make sure your child‚Äôs
      progress shows up where it matters most: in real life.
    </p>,
    <p>
      We focus on:

        {focus.map((item, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </p>,
    <p>
      Whether your child needs help learning to tolerate new textures at
      mealtimes, managing transitions throughout the day, or improving their
      ability to engage with others, we‚Äôre here to guide the process with
      compassion, expertise, and a deep respect for your child‚Äôs individuality.
      Because at Itty Bitty Kinetics, we‚Äôre not just working on skills ‚Äî we‚Äôre
      helping your family build a foundation for joy, growth, and connection.
